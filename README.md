<h3>🔬 CurioSense: Igniting STEM Curiosity<br/>
Let's learn and discover together! 🌟</h3><br/>
<p>CurioSense, an initiative provider of STEM education and training in Pakistan 🇵🇰, conduct workshops at different Schools. For example we conducted workshop at the Oxford Cambridge School -Gulshan Campus- 🎓.<br/><br/>
The workshop was attended by a group of enthusiastic students who had the opportunity to learn about a variety of STEM topics, including electronics 💡, coding 💻, and programming 📝.<br/><br/>
One of the highlights of the workshop was an activity where students used cups ☕ to build a center 🏢. This activity helped students to learn about the basic principles of engineering 🔧 and design 📐. <br/><br/>
Students also had the opportunity to learn about how to use light-dependent resistors (LDRs) 💡 and Arduino Uno boards 🧮 to create a light switch that could be turned on and off. <br/><br/>
  Finally, students learned how to control multiple lights 💡💡💡 using Arduino Uno boards.</p>
